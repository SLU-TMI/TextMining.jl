# TextMining.jl 



[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SLU-TMI/TextMining.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SLU-TMI/TextMining.jl)

This package is a set of tools being used by **Saint Louis University** to facilitate interdisciplinary research using data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques of how time passage affects language.

### Setup

Like other Julia packages, installing the *TextMining* package is done like so:

```julia
Pkg.add("TextMining")
```

These tools are being developed in **Julia** with the goal of making them fast, generic, and easily usable in Julia's REPL. The tools can be broken down into the following catagories.

1. Feature Space Model
------

These tools will utilize the [bag-of-words model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) and the [hashing trick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing) to vectorize texts into [feature vectors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_vector). Feature vectors exist in an infinite dimensional vector space which is refered to as the **feature space**. In order to optimize calculations, dimensions where the feature vector has value 0 are removed from the feature vectors hashtable. We are defining **FeatureSpace** to be an abstract type which has 3 subtypes: FeatureVector, Cluster, and DataSet.


#### Feature Vectors

The **FeatureVector** type is container for a **Dictionary (hashtable)** that restricts **key => value** mappings to **Any => Number** mappings, where *Any* and *Number* are Julia types, or their subtypes. 

###### Using FeatureVector:

Constructing an empty *FeatureVector*:
```julia
julia> fv = FeatureVector()
```

A *FeatureVector* can also be constructed using an existing *Dictionary*: 
```julia
julia> dict = ["word1"=>2, "word2"=>4]
julia> fv = FeatureVector(dict)
```
or
```julia
julia> fv = FeatureVector(["word1"=>2, "word2"=>4])
```

Modifying elements of a *FeatureVector*:
```julia
julia> fv["word1"] = 4
```

Accessing elements of a *FeatureVector*:
```julia
julia> fv["word1"]
4
```

Addition and subtraction between two *FeatureVectors*:
```julia
julia> fv1 = FeatureVector(["word1" => 2, "word2" => 4])
julia> fv2 = FeatureVector(["word1" => 4, "word2" => 2])
julia> fv1+fv2
FeatureVector{ASCIIString,Int64}(["word1"=>6,"word2"=>6])

julia> fv1-fv2
FeatureVector{ASCIIString,Int64}(["word1"=>-2,"word2"=>2])
```

Multiplication and division by a scalar:
```julia
julia> fv = FeatureVector(["word1" => 1, "word2" => 3])
julia> fv*3
FeatureVector{ASCIIString,Int64}(["word1"=>3,"word2"=>9])

julia> fv/3
FeatureVector{Any,Float64}(["word1"=>0.3333333333333333,"word2"=>1.0])

julia> fv//3
FeatureVector{ASCIIString,Rational{T<:Integer}}(["word1"=>1//3,"word2"=>1//1])
```

If a *FeatureVector* contains Integer value types it can be rationalized by a divisor:
```julia
julia> fv//3
FeatureVector{ASCIIString,Rational{T<:Integer}}(["word1"=>1//3,"word2"=>1//1])
```
but returns an error otherwise:
```julia
julia> fv = FeatureVector(["word1" => 1.0, "word2" => 3.0])
julia> fv//3
FeatureVector{ASCIIString,Rational{T<:Integer}}(["word1"=>1//3,"word2"=>1//1])
ERROR: `//` has no method matching //(::Float64, ::Int64)
```

###### FeatureVector Functions:

**keys(fv)**
> Returns an **Iterator** to the keys in **fv**.

**values(fv)**
> Returns an **Iterator** to the values in **fv**.

**haskey(fv, key)**
> Checks **fv** for **key** and returns **true** if found or **false** if not present.

**isempty(fv)**
> Returns **true** if **fv** contains any elements, **false** otherwise.

**length(fv)**
> Returns the number of elements in **fv**.

**freq\_list(fv, expression = (a,b) -> a[2]>b[2])**
> Returns a [frequency list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_lists_by_frequency) represented by an **Array** of
> (key,value) tuples sorted using the provided boolean expression. If an **expression** is
> not passed in, the Array will be sorted by largest value.

**add!(fv1, fv2)**
> In place addition. Modifies **fv1** by adding **fv2** to it. 

**subtract!(fv1, fv2)**
> In place subtraction. Modifies **fv1** by subtracting **fv2** from it. 

**cos\_dist(fv1, fv2)** 
> Returns 1-[cosine similarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between two feature vectors. If the angle
> between **fv1** and **fv2** is 0, the function will return 0. If **fv1** and **fv2** are orthogonal,
> meaning they share no features, the function will return 1. Otherwise the function returns values
> between 0 and 1. **Note:** The zero vector is both parallel and orthogonal to every vector, as such
> **cos\_dist(fv, zero_vector)** will return **NaN** (not a number). 

**zero\_dist(fv1, fv2)**
> Derived from the L0 Norm, this function returns the number of non-zero elements that differ 
> between **fv1** and **fv2**. 

**taxicab\_dist(fv1, fv2)**
> Derived from the [L1 Norm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) and also know as the Manhattan distance,
> this function returns the sum of the absolute difference between **fv1** and **fv2**. 

**euclidean\_dist(fv1, fv2)**
> Returns the [standard distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between **fv1** and **fv2**. 

**infinite\_dist(fv1, fv2)**
> Derived from the [L∞ Norm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance) and often referd to as the Chebyshev distance,
> this function returns the maximum absolute difference between any feature in **fv1** or **fv2**.


#### Clusters

The **Cluster** type is also a **Dictionary** container. However, it restricts mappings to **Any => FeatureVector** types and subtypes. This allows users to meaningfully label groups of *FeatureVectors* for Classification. The *Cluster* type also computes the centroid of the set.

An empty *Cluster* can be constructed as so:
```julia
cl = Cluster()
```

#### DataSet

The **DataSet** type is also a wrapper around a **Dictionary**. However, it restricts mappings to **Any => Cluster** types and subtypes.

An empty *DataSet* can be constructed as so:
```julia
ds = DataSet()
```

2. Clustering (developing)
------

#### Hierarchical Clustering

#### K-Means Clustering
---
3. Classification
------

### Distance Based Classifiers
---

#### k Nearest Neighbors

---
### Probability Based Classifiers

#### Distribution

The **Distribution** type is a container which ensures the [axioms of probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms).

An empty *Distribution* can be constructed as so:
```julia
ds = Distribution()
```

#### Naive Bayes (uncommenced)

4. Text Processing (uncommenced)
------

#### Processing XML Files (uncommenced)
